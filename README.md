# minesweeper
So it's a basic version of [minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) written in Vue.js.

A few points to note:
* Some games I've seen uncover swaths of space when a location that contains zero mines is clicked... plan on adding that later.
* It also doesn't do anything special when you clear the board.

Otherwise I think it's pretty straight forward and an accurate attempt at the game.
